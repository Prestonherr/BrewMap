# BrewMap ☕️🗺️

BrewMap is a coffee shop finder application that helps users explore local coffee culture. It now includes a minimal backend so users can register, log in, and persistently save favorite coffee shops. The frontend continues to use OpenStreetMap services for discovery while the backend provides user accounts and saved-shop storage.

### APIs & Backend

BrewMap uses OpenStreetMap services for discovery and a small custom backend for user data:

- **Nominatim API** (Geocoding): Converts city names to latitude/longitude coordinates

- **Backend API (local / custom REST)**: Provides endpoints for user registration, authentication, and saving/deleting coffee shops. The backend persists saved shops per user in a MongoDB database.
